                <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2025</p>
                
                <div class="terms-intro">
                    <p>We built PrivStep to respect your privacy, and our Terms of Service reflect that philosophy. We've written these terms in plain English because we believe you should understand what you're agreeing to.</p>
                </div>

                <section class="terms-section">
                    <h2>1. What PrivStep Is</h2>
                    <p>PrivStep is a privacy-first fitness tracking app for iPhone that keeps all your data locally on your device. We're currently in beta testing through Apple's TestFlight program, which means the app is still under active development.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key point:</strong> Your workout data never leaves your iPhone. We designed it this way on purpose - we can't access your data even if we wanted to, because we never built that capability.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="terms-section">
                    <h2>2. Beta Software Disclaimer</h2>
                    <p>PrivStep is beta software, which means:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Features may change or break without notice</li>
                        <li>You might experience bugs or crashes</li>
                        <li>We do our best to keep it stable, but can't guarantee perfection</li>
                        <li>Your TestFlight access may be limited or revoked</li>
                        <li>The app is provided "as is" without warranties</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By using the beta, you're helping us build a better app. Thank you for your patience!</p>

                <section class="terms-section">
                    <h2>3. GPS and Safety Warnings</h2>
                    <p><strong>Important safety information:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Don't rely on PrivStep for emergency navigation</strong> - Use dedicated GPS apps for safety-critical situations</li>
                        <li>GPS accuracy can vary based on weather, location, and device conditions</li>
                        <li>Always carry a backup navigation method when exercising in unfamiliar areas</li>
                        <li>Be aware of your surroundings - don't let the app distract you from traffic or hazards</li>
                        <li>Check local laws about phone use while cycling or in other activities</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Your safety is more important than tracking your workout. Use common sense and stay alert.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="terms-section">
                    <h2>4. Your Data, Your Control</h2>
                    <p>This is the important part - your data belongs to you:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>We cannot access your workout data</strong> - It's stored locally using iOS CoreData</li>
                        <li><strong>Our employees cannot see your data</strong> - We literally don't have the technical ability</li>
                        <li><strong>No cloud sync means no data breaches</strong> - Your data can't be hacked from our servers because we don't have servers storing your data</li>
                        <li>You can export your data anytime using the app's export feature</li>
                        <li>Deleting the app permanently removes all your data - we can't recover it</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This is privacy by design, not privacy by policy.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="terms-section">
                    <h2>5. What We Do Collect</h2>
                    <p>To be completely transparent, here's what we might collect:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Crash reports</strong> (if you opt in through iOS settings) - These help us fix bugs but contain no personal data</li>
                        <li><strong>TestFlight feedback</strong> - Only if you choose to send it</li>
                        <li><strong>That's it.</strong> No analytics, no tracking, no user profiles</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We're serious about the "privacy-first" promise.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="terms-section">
                    <h2>6. Your Responsibilities</h2>
                    <p>We ask that you:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use PrivStep responsibly and safely</li>
                        <li>Don't reverse engineer or modify the app</li>
                        <li>Provide helpful feedback to improve the app</li>
                        <li>Don't share your TestFlight invite with others (Apple's rule, not ours)</li>
                        <li>Respect others when exercising in public spaces</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section class="terms-section">
                    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
                    <p>Simple version: We own the app, you own your data.</p>
                    <p>PrivStep's code, design, and branding belong to us. Your workout data, routes, and personal information belong to you. We'll never claim ownership of your fitness data.</p>

                <section class="terms-section">
                    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
                    <p>You can stop using PrivStep anytime by deleting the app. We might end your TestFlight access if:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The beta program ends</li>
                        <li>You violate these terms</li>
                        <li>Apple requires it</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When PrivStep launches on the App Store, these beta terms will be replaced with updated terms for the public release.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="terms-section">
                    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                    <p>Legal reality: We can't be held responsible for everything. PrivStep is provided "as is" and we can't guarantee it will always work perfectly. Use it at your own risk, especially for activities where safety is important.</p>
                    <p>We're not liable for injuries, data loss, or other problems that might arise from using the app. This is standard for beta software.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="terms-section">
                    <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
                    <p>We might update these terms as PrivStep evolves. If we make significant changes, we'll let TestFlight users know. Continuing to use the app means you accept the updated terms.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="terms-section">
                    <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
                    <p>Questions about these terms? We're happy to clarify anything. You can reach us through TestFlight feedback or the contact information on our main website.</p>
                    <p>We believe in transparency and will do our best to answer your questions clearly.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> We built PrivStep to be the fitness app we wanted to use - one that respects your privacy and gives you control over your data. These terms reflect that philosophy.</p>
